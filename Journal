Reflection Sep 10th 
The topic for today's class was web development. It honestly took me a lot of time to install the required software, 
thus I was unable to do much practical stuff. But still the class was very interesting and there is a lot of content to cover.
I have never worked with HTML or CSS before, so this is completely new for me. I'll have to do some basic introductory courses 
so that I can get the basics and start moving on.
