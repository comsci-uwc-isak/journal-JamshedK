Reflection Sep 17
Today during the class we studied about Data security and cryptography. Actually I didn't quite get how you encode 
information, because sometimes I feel that I am a slow learner and I need simpler explanation to actually understand what 
is going on. We also did a little of web development which was also a little confusing, because it was kinda a little different 
from what we did last time. I forgot that we had to make folders for our IA and add the information there, so I was able to do 
that during this class, which isn't an accomplishment, but still I was able to do something. 
Hope next classes will get better.
