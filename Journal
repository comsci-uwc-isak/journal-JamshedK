Reflection for September 5
The topic for todays class was networks and it has been very interesting. Firstly, we worked about types of networks I learnt 
a little bit, but still need to go home and go through the articles again to make sure i have understood everything.  
We also worked with raspberry pi. It was also a pretty good opportunity for me to pratice working with terminal and also programming 
in terminal. I have to practice a lot at home so I can much deeper.
