Reflection Sep 13
Today in our class a group of students gave presentations about VPN, which I did not understand most of what that 
they said and it was pretty challenging for me. I also accidently deleted my journal because there was a mistake 
and it took a while to recover it.Overall this I didn't learn much from this class, because the topics that we are currently 
covering seem to challenging for me. Hope that I'll understand them very soon.
