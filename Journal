Reflection September 18th
Today we started the class with coffeescripts, a programming language that comlies to JavaScript. We did not actually do very 
very much coding. It was about how to write functions and priting in the console, which will be useful for us for debugging. 
After this we did a little of IB questions. We also checked a few IAs, and their wordcount, which gave me a better idea of 
how to do the documentation part of the IA.
