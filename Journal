Reflection Sep 20th
Today the class started working with Coffee script. We have been developing a small program that encodes messages, given a key.
Previous days we were mostly working on the design, but today we actually worked on the logical part, and it made me really 
happy when we finally made the program work, Even though I didn't understand most of the logic behind it, I'll be working on my 
own to try to figure out. After we finished developing encryption tool, we studied a little bit packet switchning with a gif 
animation, which I think was pretty useful. After that we started working on our IAs. I was able to finish the Forgot password 
of the software I am developing and it made me really happy. I have also been working on return books page, but a bug has been 
causing me trouble and I am not able to fix it yet. Overall this today, was productive to some extent, but still I am not 
satisfied.
