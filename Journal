Reflection Sep 13
The class was one of the best Computer science classes I have had so far. The thing that is good about it was that we started 
from the basics and it was easier for me to catch up, and we weren't moving as fast as we usually did in previous classes. 
I learnt how to do some basic designing in HTML and CSS, which is a very great skill to have. I'm very happy and hope that
our classes will be like that. The previous classes have been quite challenging for me, because we were moving fast and sometimes, 
when I accidently missed something, then I had no idea what was happening until the end of class. As I am new to programming, 
it's kind of hard for me to catch up with the people that are much more experienced.
