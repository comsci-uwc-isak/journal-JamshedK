The first class that we had with Doctor Ruben was an amazing class and I really enjoyed it.
Especially, the differenece between out previous classes with Ms. Jyothi and with Dr. Ruben that I realized is that 
Dr. Ruben does not only focus on the things in the syllabus, but he also makes goes beyond the syllabus to provide us 
with the questions and tasks that are very interesting and engaging. The activities that we did today was to work on 
some questions from the things that we learnt in the past, like recursions and etc, but as I haven't revised for a very 
long time I have forgotten most of it. So that's the things that I need to work on. And one task that I liked very much was
working encryption. What I realized is that you really have to pay attention to every small details of the text and that way you 
will get succesful in encrypting messages. 
Overall it was fun having a class with the new teacher and I hope it will continue with the same pace.
